struct ext4_extents_tail
========================================

path: fs/ext4/ext4_extents.h
```
/*
 * ext4_inode has i_block array (60 bytes total).
 * The first 12 bytes store ext4_extent_header;
 * the remainder stores an array of ext4_extent.
 * For non-inode extent blocks, ext4_extent_tail
 * follows the array.
 */

/*
 * This is the extent tail on-disk structure.
 * All other extent structures are 12 bytes long.  It turns out that
 * block_size % 12 >= 4 for at least all powers of 2 greater than 512, which
 * covers all valid ext4 block sizes.  Therefore, this tail structure can be
 * crammed into the end of the block without having to rebalance the tree.
