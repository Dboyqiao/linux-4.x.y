# ext4_sync_file

/*
 * akpm: A new design for ext4_sync_file().
 *
 * This is only called from sys_fsync(), sys_fdatasync() and sys_msync().
 * There cannot be a transaction open by this task.
 * Another task could have dirtied this inode.  Its data can be in any
 * state in the journalling system.
 *
 * What we do is just kick off a commit and wait on it.  This will snapshot the
 * inode to disk.

	 *  filemap_fdatawait() will encounter a ton of newly-dirtied pages
	 *  (they were dirtied by commit).  But that's OK - the blocks are
	 *  safe in-journal, which is all fsync() needs to ensure.
