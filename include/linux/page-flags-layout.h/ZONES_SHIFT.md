/*
 * When a memory allocation must conform to specific limitations (such
 * as being suitable for DMA) the caller will pass in hints to the
 * allocator in the gfp_mask, in the zone modifier bits.  These bits
 * are used to select a priority ordered list of memory zones which
 * match the requested limits. See gfp_zone() in include/linux/gfp.h
