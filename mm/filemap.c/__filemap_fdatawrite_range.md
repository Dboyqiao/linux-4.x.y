# __filemap_fdatawrite_range


```
/**
 * __filemap_fdatawrite_range - start writeback on mapping dirty pages in range
 * @mapping:	address space structure to write
 * @start:	offset in bytes where the range starts
 * @end:	offset in bytes where the range ends (inclusive)
 * @sync_mode:	enable synchronous operation
 *
 * Start writeback against all of a mapping's dirty pages that lie
 * within the byte offsets <start, end> inclusive.
 *
 * If sync_mode is WB_SYNC_ALL then this is a "data integrity" operation, as
 * opposed to a regular memory cleansing writeback.  The difference between
 * these two operations is that if a dirty page/buffer is encountered, it must
 * be waited upon, and not just skipped over.
